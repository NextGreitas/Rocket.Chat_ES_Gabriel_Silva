# Rocket.chat API Test

Searching the Rest API documentation on rocket.chat.com, we have all the necessary documentation to run these queries.

As the documentation points out, authentication is required for any query/update. For this, I created in the header the X-Auth-Token and X-User-Id, which are generated in the Token access tool on Rocket.chat workspace.
